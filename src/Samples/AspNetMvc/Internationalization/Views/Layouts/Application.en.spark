	<p>This example is actually showing two different things. One is an example of using
	the current culture and string resources built into satellite assemblies, which are accessed
	via the SR class. The other is an example of using a custom descriptor builder to have an 
	extra parameter, like culture, extend the default view location strategy.</p>
